            <p>Nael al-Barghouthi, a Palestinian from the West Bank village of Kobar, has spent nearly four decades in Israeli prisons. In 2009, he broke the Guinness World Record for the world’s longest-serving political prisoner.</p>
            <p>Israeli occupation forces initially detained Barghouthi in April 1978, but he was released in a 2011 prisoner exchange deal before being rearrested three years later.</p>
            <p>After being freed in 2011, Barghouthi tried to return to a normal life - but he had missed an entire generation. The simple lifestyle that he knew decades earlier had changed; many of his loved ones were dead, and the buildings and fields
                he remembered as a child had been consumed by urban development.</p>
            <p>While he was out of prison, Barghouthi married his longtime sweetheart, Eman Nafe, who herself had spent 10 years in Israeli prison.</p>
            <p>He spent much of his time around olive trees, which relieved his nostalgia and showed the importance of deep roots in the face of time. These trees were the heritage of his forefathers - the identity of Palestine that Barghouthi loved and
                fought for, and the reason he spent so much of his life in the darkness of prison.</p>
            <p>In his few years of freedom, Barghouthi worked in olive groves, watering, trimming and picking the harvest. The occupation gave him little time to enjoy his peace: he was arrested again in the summer of 2014 and sentenced to 30 months in prison
                for under flimsy charges of violating the terms of his release. Just as he was due to be freed, an Israeli military tribunal issued an order reinstating his life sentence, plus an additional 18 years.</p>
            <p>Barghouthi’s story, and his suffering over all these decades, raises many questions. Where does one find the strength to spend almost all of one's life in prison?</p>
            <p>Four decades is a long time to live in pain, sadness, oppression and deprivation. How many people were born during that time, and how many passed away? How many moments of joy, sadness, reunion and separation? How many warm nights with family
                and friends were missed? How many opportunities and experiences were lost?</p>
