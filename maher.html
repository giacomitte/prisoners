            <p>Maher Younis was born on January 9, 1958 in the village of Ara / Northern Triangle in the 48 lands. He is one brother of five sisters. He completed his primary studies in the village schools, then joined the agricultural school in the city
                of Hadera. On January 18, 1983, the occupation army arrested him Two weeks after the arrest of his cousin, the dean of prisoners, Karim Younis, and after interrogation, the military prosecutor of the occupying power charged him with belonging
                to the Fatah movement and illegal possession of weapons.</p>
            <p>And killed an Israeli soldier, and at the beginning of his arrest, the occupation courts issued a death sentence against him by hanging, along with the two prisoners, Karim and Sami Younes. A month later, the occupation court returned and
                issued a ruling reducing the sentence from death to life imprisonment. A 40-year life sentence was imposed on a number of the 48 prisoners, including Maher.
            </p>
            <p>The prisoner Younes was arrested before he married, and thus he spent his youthful years in detention without establishing a family, and today he is deprived even of getting to know his nephews and nieces, by a decision of the Central Court
                in Nazareth to deprive him of visiting his relatives of the second degree, and a petition to submit He was taken prisoner in 2008 to see his father on his deathbed, to die without seeing him or saying his farewell after years of hiatus</p>
            <p>The prisoner Younes had waged an open hunger strike for 10 days, on February 25, 2013, while he was in the Gilboa prison, in order to shed light on the suffering of the prisoners in the occupation prisons, especially the 48 prisoners, who
                are denied exchange deals.
            </p>
            <p>It is noteworthy that the prisoner Younis was among those who agreed upon the start of political negotiations in late July 2013 to release them in four batches, as Israel committed to release three batches of (26) prisoners in each batch.
                It was supposed to take place at the end of March of 2013, and it has kept them in its prisons until today. They are (27) prisoners, half of whom are from the 1948 lands. They are: Karim Younis, Maher Younis, Ibrahim, Rushdi Abu Mokh,
                Walid Daqqa, Ibrahim Bayadsa, and Ahmed Abu Jaber, Bashir al-Khatib, Ibrahim Agbariya, Muhammad Agbariya, Yahya Agbariya, and Muhammad Jabareen
