            <p>Ashkelon Central Prison was established during the British Mandate era as the headquarters of the British Army Command in Ashkelon and its environs, and Kasraya to receive official British delegations. Inside the Ashkelon Brigades, a section
                of the building was designated as an interrogation and detention center.</p>
            <p>After the defeat of 1967 and the escalation of the Palestinian resistance and the increase in the number of detainees, the Israeli army command issued in 1970 a military decree opening Ashkelon Central Prison. The opening of the prison witnessed
                the abuse of Palestinian prisoners, as they were passing through two rows of prison guards from the gate to the prison rooms and cells, while the batons were heaped on their bodies.</p>
            <p>There are five sections in this prison next to the cells section, in addition to a special wing of the Israeli Shin Bet to interrogate Palestinian and Arab prisoners. The prison authorities imposed forced labor on the prisoners in the workshops
                attached to the prison. The prisoners were able to boycott the work facilities completely through a long series of protests, whether against detention or against forcing them to work.</p>
