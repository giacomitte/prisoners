            <p>Nafkha Prison is a prison located 100 km from the city of Beersheba and 200 km from the city of Jerusalem. It is one of the most cruel Israeli prisons. This prison was created specifically for the Palestinian leaders of detainees in various
                prisons, in order to isolate them from the rest of the other prisons. It holds about 700 prisoners between its walls.</p>
            <p>The new building in Nafkha Prison consists of 3 sections, each section of which can accommodate about (120) detainees. The height of the room is about (2.5 meters) with one window for ventilation, an area of ​​about (80 x 120 cm).</p>
            <p>Life is very difficult, as the detainees go to the al-Fora (the square) twice a day, once in the morning and another in the evening, for a total of about 3 hours a day. iron. Despite the urgent need of the detainees to go out, many of them
                are reluctant to go out due to the limited space allocated and the inability to engage in some exercise in it, as the floor is very smooth and leads to skating
            </p>
            <p>The prisoners suffer from many chronic diseases, as medical neglect, in addition to the fact that booking the clinic for treatment requires a period of no more than two months, and painkillers are the only medicine for all diseases, as the
                prison administration is determined to harm the prisoners and deprive them of their most basic rights.</p>
            <p>One of the most famous events in this prison was the long hunger strike carried out by the Palestinian prisoners on July 7, 1980, which resulted in the death of two of them.</p>
